## I. Global Terminology & Stat Definitions
*Source: research/data/ingame-screenshots/LoadoutUI/VariousLoadoutPanelWeaponModArmorHoverDetailsUI.png*

### 1. Primary Offense
*   **Attack**: Base offensive power for physical/weapon damage.
*   **Psi Intensity**: Primary scaling factor for Status and Elemental damage (e.g., Power Surge, Burn).
*   **Crit Rate / Crit DMG**: Multipliers for critical hits.
*   **Weakspot DMG**: Multiplier applied when hitting enemy weakpoints.

### 2. Keywords & Bucket Classifications
> **Note on Translation Errors (ADR-002/ADR-014 Analysis):**
> *   **DMG Coefficient**: This term (seen on Mayfly Goggles, Gas-tight Helmet) is a translation error for the **DMG Factor** pool. In-game testing ("The 113 Test") proves that Factor and Coefficient are **additive** with each other within a single multiplicative bucket.
> *   **Ultimate DMG**: This term (seen on First Electrocution mod) is a translation error for **Final DMG Bonus**. It behaves as a multiplier in the Final DMG bucket. Do not implement as a separate bucket.

*   **Status DMG Bonus**: Global multiplier for all status-related damage (Burn, Frost Vortex, etc.).
*   **Elemental DMG Bonus**: Categories: **Blaze**, **Frost**, and **Shock**. (Note: "Flammable" and "Blast" are occasionally used interchangeably with "Blaze" and "Blast/Explosion" depending on translation/typos in set descriptions).
*   **Keyword DMG Bonus**: Specific multipliers (e.g., "Burn DMG Bonus"). Standard mods often abbreviate this to "[Keyword] DMG" (e.g., "Unstable Bomber DMG +5%", "Frost Vortex DMG +10%").
*   **DMG Factor**: (e.g., "Burn DMG Factor") - Multiplier for specific keyword effects. Often listed as a percentage (e.g., +15.0%).
*   **Final DMG**: (e.g., "Bounce Final DMG") - Appears to be a separate multiplicative bucket from "DMG Factor". **Examples**: `Pinpoint Strike` ("Unstable Bomber final DMG + 35%"), `Delayed Blast` ("the bomb's final DMG +25%"), `Break Bounce` ("the bullet's final DMG +25%"), and `Sleek Leather Jacket` ("Unstable Bomber Final DMG +2%").
*   **Ultimate DMG**: **(FLAG: Unique Wording)** An obscure multiplier, highly likely to be its own multiplicative bucket or a translation variant of Final DMG. **Example**: `First Electrocution` ("Power Surge's Ultimate DMG + 35%").
*   **DMG Coefficient**: (e.g., "Shrapnel DMG Coefficient") - Multiplier applied to base values. **Examples**: `Viper Mask` ("Unstable Bomber DMG coefficient +1%"), `Gas-tight Helmet` ("Shrapnel DMG Coefficient +150%"), `Mayfly Goggles` ("Power Surge DMG Coefficient -30%"), and `Gas Mask Hood` ("Power Surge DMG Coefficient +15%").

### 3. Set-Specific Mechanics & States
*   **Lone Shadow**: Stacking buff from Lonewolf Set granting Crit DMG.
*   **Archer's Focus**: Stacking buff from Renegade Set granting Weakspot DMG.
*   **Deviant Energy**: Stacking buff from Shelterer Set granting Elemental DMG.
*   **Bastille State**: Immobile stance from Bastille Set granting Weapon DMG, with severe Stamina penalties upon exit.
*   **Powered Armor**: Defensive stacks from Stormweaver Set granting DMG Reduction, consumable by rolling for AoE damage and healing.
*   **Bullet Saver**: Effect from Agent Set triggered by precise kills, granting Weakspot DMG.
*   **Deviant Power / Energy**: Resource consumed by Battle Skills, interacted with by Dark Resonance Set for Gun and Status DMG scaling.
*   **Sanity**: Survival metric. Low Sanity usually reduces Max HP, but Treacherous Tides mitigates this and scales damage based on Sanity drops.

## VI. Suffix & Suffix Scaling Logic
*Source: research/data/ingame-screenshots/Mod/LunarCrescentSubstatPercents.png*

### 1. Lunar Suffix (Inverse HP Scaling)
*   **Condition**: The lower your HP, the higher the bonus.
*   **Max Trigger**: Bonus is maximized at low HP (Community consensus ≤ 30%).
*   **Verified Peak Values (Gold/Legendary)**:
    *   **Crit DMG**: +30.0%
    *   **Elemental DMG**: +16.0%
    *   **Weapon / Status DMG**: +12.0%
*   **Scaling Pattern (Purple/Epic)**: Provides exactly 80% of Gold peak (e.g., 24% Crit DMG).

### 2. Crescent Suffix (Shield Threshold Scaling)
*   **Condition**: Provides a base bonus, plus an extra bonus based on Shield (triggers at 40% Shield).
*   **Verified Peak Values (Gold/Legendary)**:
    *   **Crit DMG**: +10.0% (Base) + 15.0% (Extra) = **+25.0% Peak**
    *   **Elemental DMG**: +5.0% (Base) + 8.0% (Extra) = **+13.0% Peak**
    *   **Weapon / Status DMG**: +4.0% (Base) + 6.0% (Extra) = **+10.0% Peak**
